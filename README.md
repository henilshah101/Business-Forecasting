# Retail Gas Price Prediction

summary:
This project seeks to understand the change in gasoline prices based on consumer behavior over a span of 18 years: namely, to compare gasoline prices to the number of registrations of conventional cars, sales of Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs), and vehicle fuel consumption (all in the U.S.). The objective is to be able to accurately predict the gasoline price in the US market for the coming years. We use reported data tracked on a monthly basis from January 2000 through December 2017. Our task is to forecast the gasoline price in 2018 based on analysis of past performance and dependencies on consumer behaviour using fpp module in R. We will measure the accuracy of the forecast by comparing our results to actual data published for 2018 using RMSE error technique.

Data information:
The gas pricing data was obtained from Kaggle, which linked to the U.S. Energy Administration Information dataset for U.S. gasoline prices. Conventional car registration data was found at the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration's Office of Highway Policy Information website. Sales of Electric Vehicles were obtained from the U.S. Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center, and natural gas vehicle fuel consumption was found on the U.S. Energy Administration Information's website.
